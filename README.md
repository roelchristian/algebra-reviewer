Graduate algebra reviewer

These are my review notes for the graduate algebra comprehensive exam at De La Salle University. These notes are mainly based on Aluffi's "Algebra: Chapter 0" and Hungerford's "Algebra".

This is a work in progress but will follow the following outline:

1. Preliminaries (sets, functions, categories, etc.)
2. Groups
    - Basic definitions
    - Homomorphisms and the category $\mathbf{Grp}$
    - Free groups
    - Subgroups, normal subgroups, and quotient groups
    - Isomorphism theorems
    - Group actions
    - Sylow theorems
    - Direct and semidirect products
3. Rings and modules
4. Fields and Galois theory
