\section{Definition and basic properties}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{group} is a pair \((G, \mult)\) where \(G\) is a  set and \(\mult\)
    is a binary operation on \(G\) (i.e., a map from \(G \times G\) to \(G\))
    that satisfies the following axioms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Associativity:} For all \(a, b, c \in G\), \(\mult(\mult(a,
        b), c) = \mult(a, \mult(b, c))\).
        \item \emph{Identity element:} There exists an element \(e \in G\) such
        that for all \(a \in G\), \(\mult(e, a) = \mult(a, e) = a\).
        \item \emph{Inverses:} For each \(a \in G\), there exists an element
        \(a^{-1} \in G\) such that \(\mult(a, a^{-1}) = \mult(a^{-1}, a) = e\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    If the pair \((G, \mult)\) satisfies only the first two axioms, then it is
    called a \emph{monoid}. If it satisfies only the first axiom, then it is
    called a \emph{semigroup}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    We shall succumb to some abuse of language and refer to the group \((G,
    \mult)\) simply as the group \(G\) when the binary operation \(\mult\) is
    clear from the context. We shall also write \(ab\) or \(a \cdot b\) instead
    of \(\mult(a, b)\) for the image of \((a, b)\) under the binary operation.
    We shall call the binary operation `multiplication' and the element \(ab\)
    the `product' of \(a\) and \(b\).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    Because we require the existence of an identity element in a group \(G\), we
    can conclude that the set \(G\) is nonempty. At the very least it must
    contain the identity element. This group is called the \emph{trivial group}
    and is denoted by \(\{e\}\). Note also that any singleton \(\{*\}\) is a
    group if we define the binary operation to be the trivial operation
    \(\mult(*, *) = *\) so that the choice of writing \(\{e\}\) instead of
    \(\{*\}\) or any other symbol is purely a matter of convention.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    The identity element in a group is unique. For each \(a \in G\), the inverse
    element of \(a\) is unique.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose \(e\) and \(e'\) are both identity elements of a group \(G\). Then
    \[
        e = e \cdot e' = e'.
    \]
    Similarly, uppose \(b\) and \(b'\) are both inverses of \(a \in G\). Then
    \[
        b = b \cdot e = b \cdot (a \cdot b') = (b \cdot a) \cdot b' = e \cdot b' = b'.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The preceding result allow us to speak of \emph{the} identity element and
    \emph{the} inverse of an element in a group.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a \in G\). Then \((a^{-1})^{-1} = a\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose \(b \neq a\) is the inverse of \(a^{-1}\) where \(b \in G\). Then
    \(a^{-1}b = e = ba^{-1}\). But \(a\) also satisfies this property, and since
    inverses are unique, we must have \(b = a\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(G\) be a group and \(a, b\) elements of \(G\). Then \((ab)^{-1} =
    b^{-1}a^{-1}\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We have
    \[
        (ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = a(bb^{-1})a^{-1} = aea^{-1} = aa^{-1} = e.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Generalized associative law]
    \label{thm:generalized-associative-law}
    Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) be elements of \(G\).
    Then the product \(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n\) is well-defined, i.e., it is
    independent of the way in which the product is bracketed.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove this by induction on \(n\). The case \(n = 2\) is the associative
    axiom in our definition of a group. If \(n > 2\), then from the definition
    of associativity
    \[
        a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_m)(a_{m + 1} \cdots a_n)
    \]
    for some \(m < n\). By induction we then have
    \begin{align*}
        a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n & = \left(\prod_{i = 1}^m a_i\right)\left(\prod_{i = 1}^{n - m} a_{m + i}\right)\\
        & = \left(\prod_{i =1}^{m}\right)\left(\left(\prod_{i = 1}^{n - m - 1} a_{m + i}\right)a_n\right)\\
        & = \left(\left(\prod_{i = 1}^{m}\right)\left(\prod_{i = 1}^{n - m- 1} a_{m + i}\right)\right)a_n\\
        & = \left(\prod_{i = 1}^{n - 1} a_i\right)a_n.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    Theorem \ref{thm:generalized-associative-law} tells us that we can write
    \(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n\) as a meaningful product without the need for
    brackets. Where each of the \(a_i\) is equal to an element \(a\) of the
    group, we shall write \(a^n\) for the product of \(n\) terms of \(a\). Thus
    \(a^1 = a\), \(a^2 = aa\), and so on. We also define \(a^0\) to be the
    identity element of the group and \(a^{-n}\) to be \((a^{-1})^n\).
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    If \(G\) is a group and \(a \in G\), then for all integers \(m, n\),
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \((a^n)^{-1} = (a^{-1})^n\),
        \item \(a^m a^n = a^{m + n}\), and
        \item \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove each part in turn.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), wide]
        \item We prove this by induction on \(n\). The case \(n = 1\) is
        trivial. Suppose the result holds for \(n = k\). Then
        \begin{align*}
            a^{k + 1} & = a^k a\\
            (a^{k + 1})^{-1} & = (a^k a)^{-1} = a^{-1} (a^k)^{-1}\\
            & = a^{-1} (a^{-1})^k = (a^{-1})^{k + 1}.
        \end{align*}
        \item We only outline the proof. For \(m > 0\), \(n > 0\) this result
        follows directly from the generalized associative law. For \(m < 0\),
        \(n < 0\), we can replace \(a, m, n\) by \(a^{-1}, -m, -n\) respectively
        and argue similarly. The case \(m = 0\) and \(n = 0\) is trivial. The
        case \(m \geq 0\), \(n < 0\) and \(m < 0\), \(n \geq 0\) can be shown by
        induction on \(m\) and \(n\), respectively.
        
        \item TODO

    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Cancellation laws]
    Let \(G\) be a group. For all \(a, b, c \in G\),
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If \(ab = ac\), then \(b = c\).
        \item If \(ba = ca\), then \(b = c\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove the first statement. Suppose \(ab = ac\). Then
    \begin{align*}
        a^{-1}(ab) &= a^{-1}(ac) &\\
        (a^{-1}a)b &= (a^{-1}a)c &\text{(associativity)}\\
        eb &= ec &\text{(definition of inverse)}\\
        b &= c. &\text{(definition of identity)}
    \end{align*}
    The second statement is proved similarly.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    A group \(G\) is said to be \emph{abelian} (or \emph{commutative}) if for
    all \(a, b \in G\),
    \[
        ab = ba.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    As a matter of convention, we shall write
    \[
        a + b \quad \text{instead of} \quad ab
    \]
    in an abelian group and refer to the operation and the term \(a + b\) as
    `addition' and the `sum' of \(a\) and \(b\), respectively. We shall also
    write \(-a\) instead of \(a^{-1}\), \(na\) instead of \(a^n\), and \(0\) for
    the identity element of the group. The sum \(a + (-b)\) for elements \(a,
    b\) of an abelian group will also be abbreviated to \(a - b\). Note that
    \(na\) does not refer to the `group product' in the sense of our definition
    of a group, but is purely a matter of notation.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    In an abelian group \(G\), \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) and \((ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}
    b^{-1}\) for all \(a, b \in G\) and all integers \(n\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    An element \(a\) of a group \(G\) is said to have \emph{finite order} if
    there exists a positive integer \(n\) such that \(a^n = e\). In this case,
    the smallest such positive integer is called the \emph{order} of \(a\) and
    is denoted by \(\order{a}\). If no such positive integer exists, then \(a\)
    is said to have \emph{infinite order} and we write \(\order{a} = \infty\).
\end{definition}



\section{Examples of groups}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(X\) be a set. The set of all bijections from \(X\) to itself forms a
    group under composition of functions, called the \emph{symmetric group} (or
    \emph{permutation group}) on \(X\), denoted by \(S_X\). If \(X = \{1, 2,
    \ldots, n\}\), then we write \(S_n\) instead of \(S_X\).
\end{definition}

% \begin{example} Consider the set \(X = \{1, 2\}\). Let \(\sigma\) be the map
%     that maps every element of \(X\) to itself, i.e., \(1 \mapsto 1\) and \(2
%     \mapsto 2\) and let \(\tau\) be the map that swaps the elements of \(X\),
%     i.e., \(1 \mapsto 2\) and \(2 \mapsto 1\). The set \(\{\sigma, \tau\}\)
%     are the only possible permutations of \(X\). The group \(S_X\) is then
%     given by \end{example}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:zmodn}
    Let \(n\) be a positive integer. Recall that congruence modulo \(n\),
    defined by
    \[
        a \equiv b \pmod{n} \quad \text{if and only if} \quad n \mid (a - b),
    \]
    for all integers \(a, b\), is an equivalence relation on \(\Z\). The set of
    equivalence classes modulo \(n\) forms a group under addition modulo \(n\),
    denoted by \(\Z/n\Z\).
\end{definition}

\section{Homomorphisms and the category {\normalfont\sffamily Grp}}

\begin{sectionthm}
    Recall that we have defined a group to be the pair \((G, m_G)\) where \(G\)
    is a set and \(m_G\) is a binary operation on \(G\). That is, \(m_G\) is a
    map from \(G \times G\) to \(G\). For two groups \((G, m_G)\) and \((H,
    m_H)\), we would like to define a map
    \[
        \phi: (G, m_G) \to (H, m_H)
    \]
    that is a function (which with some abuse of notation we shall also denote
    by \(\phi\)) between the underlying sets \(G\) and \(H\) that `preserves'
    the group structure.

    If we define the function
    \[
        \phi \times \phi: G \times G \to H \times H
    \]
    by \((a, b) \mapsto (\phi(a), \phi(b))\), then we get the following diagram:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G \times G \arrow{r}{\phi \times \phi} \arrow[swap]{d}{m_G} & H \times H \arrow{d}{m_H} \\
            G \arrow{r}{\phi} & H
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    By requiring that the diagram commute, we obtain a function \(\phi: G \to
    H\) that does exactly what we want. Indeed if the diagram commutes, then for
    all \(a, b \in G\),
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            (a, b) \arrow[swap, mapsto]{d}{m_G} & & (a, b) \arrow{r}{\phi \times \phi} & (\phi(a), \phi(b)) \arrow[mapsto]{d}{m_H} \\
            a\cdot b \arrow[mapsto]{r}{\phi} & \phi(a\cdot b) && \phi(a)\cdot\phi(b)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    where \(\cdot\) on the left-hand side is the group operation in \(G\) and
    \(\cdot\) on the right-hand side is the group operation in \(H\). Since the
    diagram commutes, we must arrive at the same element in \(H\) by following
    the two paths. This gives us the following more familiar definition.
\end{sectionthm}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(G\) and \(H\) be groups. A \emph{homomorphism} from \(G\) to \(H\) is
    a map \(\phi: G \to H\) that satisfies
    \[
        \phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)
    \]
    for all \(a, b \in G\).

    We introduce some additional terminology. If a homomorphism \(\phi: G \to
    H\) is injective as a map between sets, then we say that \(\phi\) is a
    \emph{monomorphism}. If \(\phi\) is surjective, then we say that \(\phi\) is
    an \emph{epimorphism}. If \(\phi\) is both injective and surjective, then we
    say that \(\phi\) is an \emph{isomorphism}. In this case, we say that \(G\)
    and \(H\) are \emph{isomorphic} and write \(G \cong H\).

    A homomorphism from a group to itself is called an \emph{endomorphism}. An
    isomorphism from a group to itself is called an \emph{automorphism}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    We are again being imprecise but we shall not distinguish between the the
    multiplications in \(G\) and \(H\) and simply write \(\phi(ab) =
    \phi(a)\phi(b)\) when the context is clear.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    If \(G\) and \(H\) are groups, we denote the set of group homomorphisms from
    \(G\) to \(H\) as
    \[
        \Hom_{\Grp}(G, H).
    \]
    This allows us to define the category \(\Grp\) whose objects are groups and
    whose morphisms are group homomorphisms as in the following theorem.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    The category \(\Grp\) is a category whose objects are groups and whose
    morphisms are group homomorphisms.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    
\end{proof}

\begin{sectionthm}
    It should be noted that we have defined morphisms in the category \(\Grp\)
    using only the underlying set and the corresponding group operation.
    However, our definition of a group also posits the existence of an identity
    element and of inverses. We are able to do so because, as the following
    theorem shows, preserving the group operation is enough to preserve the
    identity element and inverses.
\end{sectionthm}

\begin{theorem}
    A homomorphism preserves the identity element and inverses, i.e., given a
    homomorphism \(\phi: G \to H\),
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(\phi(e_G) = e_H\), and
        \item \(\phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1}\),
    \end{enumerate}
    where \(e_G\) and \(e_H\) are the identity elements of \(G\) and \(H\)
    respectively, and \(a \in G\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove each part in turn.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), wide]
        \item We have \(\phi(e_G) = \phi(e_G e_G) = \phi(e_G) \phi(e_G)\). This
        implies that \(\phi(e_G) = e_H\).
        \item Multiplying \(\phi(a)\) by \(\phi(a^{-1})\) gives us
        \(\phi(a)\phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(aa^{-1}) = \phi(e_G) = e_H\). This implies
        that \(\phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1}\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The second assertion in the preceding theorem is equivalent to saying that
    the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G \arrow{r}{\phi} \arrow[swap]{d}{\id_G} & H \arrow{d}{\id_H} \\
            G \arrow[swap]{r}{\phi} & H
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes. (Here \(\id_G\) and \(\id_H\) are the identity maps on \(G\) and
    \(H\) respectively.)
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    We return to \(\Hom(G, H)\). Clearly \(\Hom(G, H)\) is non-empty because we
    can construct at the very least a homomorphism that maps every element of
    \(G\) to the identity element of \(H\). Alternatively, from a
    category-theoretic perspective, the fact thet the trivial group are initial
    and terminal objects in \(\Grp\) allows us to define the unique morphisms
    \[
        G \to T \quad \text{and} \quad T \to G
    \]
    (where \(T\) is the trivial group) whose composition is exactly the
    homomorphism that maps every element of \(G\) to the identity element of
    \(H\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Consider the dihedral group \(D_6\) (recall that \(D_6\) is the group of
    symmetries of a regular triangle) and the map \(D_6 \to S_3\) that sends
    each symmetry of the triangle to the corresponding permutation of the
    vertices. We claim that this map is a group homomorphism.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    The exponential function is a homomorphism from the group of real numbers
    under addition to the group of positive real numbers under multiplication.
    Indeed,
    \[
        \exp (a + b) = \exp a \exp b.
    \]
    A similar class of examples can be given by defining the map \(\epsilon_g :
    \Z \to G\) for some group \(G\) by \(\epsilon_g(n) = g^n\) for some \(g \in
    G\). This is a homomorphism because
    \[
        \epsilon_g(m + n) = g^{m + n} = g^m g^n = \epsilon_g(m) \epsilon_g(n).
    \]
    The image of \(\epsilon_g\) is a cyclic subgroup of \(G\) generated by
    \(g\). Therefore if \(\epsilon_g\) is surjective, then \(G\) itself must be
    cyclic and generated by \(g\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let \(n\) be a positive integer. The map \(\Z \to \Z/n\Z\) defined by \(a
    \mapsto [a]_n\) for all \(a \in G\) (and where \([a]_n\) is the equivalence
    class of \(a\) modulo \(n\)) is a group homomorphism. Since this is
    equivalent to sending \(a\) to \(a \cdot [1]_n\) we see that this is the
    same as the map \(\epsilon_{[1]_n}\) in the preceding example.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
    \label{rem:homomorphism-order}
    As our motivation for defining a group homomorphism was the desire to find a
    mapping that preserves the group structure, it should be natural to ask
    whether it would also preserve the order of an element in a group. If we
    consider an element \(g\) of order \(n\) in a group \(G\) and a group
    homomorphism \(\phi: G \to H\), we can establish by induction that
    \[
        \phi(g)^n = \phi(g^n) = \phi(e_G) = e_H.
    \]
    More precisely, we have:
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:order-divides-n-homomorphism}
    Let \(\phi: G \to H\) be a group homomorphism and let \(g \in G\) be an
    element of finite order. Then \(\order{\phi(g)}\) divides \(\order{g}\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since \(\phi(g)^{\order{g}} = e_H\) as we have remarked in
    \S~\ref{rem:homomorphism-order}, Theorem~\ref{thm:order-divides-n} gives us
    this result.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    There are no nontrivial homomorphisms from the group of integers under
    addition modulo \(n\) to the additive group of integers. Since every element
    of \(\Z/n\Z\) has finite order, the preceding theorem implies that the image
    of any homomorphism from \(\Z/n\Z\) to \(\Z\) must be the identity \(0\) as
    it is the only element of finite order in \(\Z\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    It is important to note that Theorem~\ref{thm:order-divides-n-homomorphism}
    does not imply that the order itself is preserved. As a counterexample,
    consider the element \(1 \in \Z\) and the map \(\pi_n : \Z \to \Z/n\Z\)
    defined by \(a \mapsto [a]_n\). The order of \(1\) in \(\Z\) is infinite,
    but the order of \(\pi_n(1)\) in \(\Z/n\Z\) is \(n\). Isomorphisms, however,
    do preserve the order of elements, as we shall see in the following
    sections.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
    An isomorphism of groups \(\phi: G \to H\) is an isomorphism in the category
    \(\Grp\), i.e., it admits an inverse
    \[
        \phi^{-1}: H \to G
    \]
    that is also a group homomorphism.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that \(\phi: G \to H\) is an isomorphism of groups (i.e., it is
    bijective as a map between sets). Then it has an inverse \(\phi^{-1}: H \to
    G\) that is also a map between sets. We claim that \(\phi^{-1}\) is a group
    homomorphism. Let \(a, b \in H\). Then there exist \(x, y \in G\) such that
    \(\phi(x) = a\) and \(\phi(y) = b\). We have
    \[
        \phi^{-1}(ab) = \phi^{-1}(\phi(x)\phi(y)) = \phi^{-1}(\phi(xy)) = xy = \phi^{-1}(a)\phi^{-1}(b).
    \]
    
    Conversely, suppose that \(\phi\) is a group homomorphism that admits an
    inverse \(\phi^{-1}\) that is also a group homomorphism. Then \(\phi\) is
    bijective as a map between sets and thus an isomorphism of groups.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
    Let \(\phi: G \to H\) be an isomorphism. Then \(\order{\phi(g)} =
    \order{g}\) for all \(g \in G\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(\phi : G \to H\) be an isomorphism. Then \(G\) is abelian if and only
    if \(H\) is abelian.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that \(G\) is abelian. Then for all \(a, b \in H\), we have
    \[
        \phi(a)\phi(b) = \phi(ab) = \phi(ba) = \phi(b)\phi(a),
    \]
    so \(H\) is abelian. The proof for the converse is similar.
\end{proof}

\section{Free groups}

\begin{sectionthm}
    Given some set \(X\) that does not necessarily have any group structure, we
    would now like to construct another group \(F(X)\) containing \(X\) as a
    subset
\end{sectionthm}

\section{Subgroups}

\begin{remark}
    Another way to construct a group is to look at subsets of a group that are
    themselves groups. Consider a group \((G, \mult)\) and a subset \(H\) of
    the underlying set \(G\). Suppose further that \((H, \mult')\) is itself a
    group. How are the group operations \(\mult\) and \(\mult'\) related? We
    first consider the following definition.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    Let \((G, \mult)\) and \((H, \mult')\) be groups such that \(H \subset G\).
    We say that \(H\) is a \emph{subgroup} of \(G\) the inclusion function
    \(\iota : H \to G\) is a group homomorphism. If \(H\) is a subgroup of
    \(G\), we write \(H < G\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Let us first fix some notation and write \(a \cdot b\) for \(\mult(a,b)\)
    and \(a * b\) for \(\mult'(a,b)\). Then because \(\iota\) is a group
    homomorphism, we have
    \[
        \iota(a * b) = \iota(a) \cdot \iota(b).
    \]
    Moreover, because \(\iota\) is a group homomorphism, it must preserve the
    identity element and inverses. Thus \(\iota(e_H) = e_G\) and \(\iota(a^{-1})
    = \iota(a)^{-1}\) for all \(a \in H\). We can thus see that the group
    operation \(\mult'\) in \(H\) is the restriction of the group operation
    \(\mult\) in \(G\) to \(H\). Thus, we can alternatively characterize a
    subgroup as a subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) that is itself a group under the
    group operation of \(G\). The next result is a useful criterion for
    determining whether a subset is a subgroup.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Subgroup test]
    \label{thm:subgroup-test}
    A nonempty subset \(H\) of a group \(G\) is a subgroup if and only if for
    all \(a, b \in H\), we have \(ab^{-1} \in H\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The forward implication follows directly from the definition. Conversely,
    suppose that \(H\) is a nonempty subset of \(G\) such that \(ab^{-1} \in H\)
    for all \(a, b \in H\). Then \(e = aa^{-1} \in H\) for all \(a \in H\).
    Moreover, if \(a \in H\), then \(a^{-1} = ea^{-1} \in H\). Finally, if \(a,
    b \in H\), then \(ab = a(b^{-1})^{-1} \in H\). Thus \(H\) is a subgroup of
    \(G\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:intersection-subgroups}
    If \(\{H_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}\) is any collection of subgroups of a
    group \(G\), then the intersection
    \[
        H = \bigcap_{\alpha \in A} H_{\alpha}
    \]
    is a subgroup of \(G\). Moreover \(H\) is the largest subgroup of \(G\)
    contained in each of the subgroups \(H_{\alpha}\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The intersection \(H\) is nonempty because \(e \in H_\alpha\) for all
    \(\alpha\). If \(a, b \in H\), then \(a, b \in H_\alpha\) for all \(\alpha
    \in A\). Thus \(ab^{-1} \in H_\alpha\) for all \(\alpha \in A\), so
    \(ab^{-1} \in H\).

    To show that \(H\) is the largest subgroup of \(G\) contained in each of the
    subgroups \(H_{\alpha}\), suppose that \(K\) is a subgroup of \(G\) such
    that \(K \subset H_{\alpha}\) for all \(\alpha \in A\). Then by our
    definition of \(H\), we have \(K \subset H\).
\end{proof}

\section{Quotient groups and the isomorphism theorems}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\) and \(a, b \in G\). We say that
    \(a\) is \emph{left congruent} to \(b\) modulo \(H\) if \(a^{-1}b \in H\)
    and write \(a \equiv_L b \pmod{H}\). Similarly, we say that \(a\) is
    \emph{right congruent} to \(b\) modulo \(H\) if \(ba^{-1} \in H\) and write
    \(a \equiv_R b \pmod{H}\). If \(a \equiv_L b \pmod{H}\) and \(a \equiv_R b
    \pmod{H}\), then we say that \(a\) is \emph{congruent} to \(b\) modulo \(H\)
    and simply write \(a \equiv b \pmod{H}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then left (resp. right) congruence
    modulo \(H\) is an equivalence relation on \(G\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove that left congruence is an equivalence relation. The proof that
    right congruence is an equivalence relation is similar.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Reflexivity:} For all \(a \in G\), we have \(a^{-1}a = e \in
        H\), so \(a \equiv_L a \pmod{H}\).
        \item \emph{Symmetry:} Suppose \(a \equiv_L b \pmod{H}\). Then \(a^{-1}b
        \in H\), so \((a^{-1}b)^{-1} = b^{-1}a \in H\), i.e., \(b \equiv_L a
        \pmod{H}\).
        \item \emph{Transitivity:} Suppose \(a \equiv_L b \pmod{H}\) and \(b
        \equiv_L c \pmod{H}\). Then \(a^{-1}b \in H\) and \(b^{-1}c \in H\), so
        \((a^{-1}b)(b^{-1}c) = a^{-1}c \in H\), i.e., \(a \equiv_L c \pmod{H}\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:cosets-equiv-classes}
    The equivalence class of an element \(a \in G\) under left (resp. right)
    congruence modulo \(H\) is given by \(aH = \{ah : h \in H\}\) (resp. \(Ha =
    \{ha : h \in H\}\)).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The equivalence class of \(a\) under left congruence modulo \(H\) is given
    by
    \[
        \{ x \in G : x \equiv_L a \pmod{H} \} = \{ x \in G : x^{-1}a \in H \}.
    \]
    Since \(H < G\), \((x^{-1}a)^{-1} = a^{-1}x \in H\). Thus \(a^{-1}x = h\)
    for some \(h \in H\), and so \(x = ah\). The proof for right congruence is
    similar.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    The sets \(aH\) and \(Ha\) in Theorem~\ref{thm:cosets-equiv-classes} are
    called the \emph{left coset} and \emph{right coset} of \(H\) containing
    \(a\), respectively.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then \(\order{aH} = \order{H} =
    \order{Ha}\) for all \(a \in G\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the map \(\phi: H \to aH\) defined by \(\phi(h) = ah\). We claim
    that \(\phi\) is a bijection. The map is clearly surjective. Suppose
    \(\phi(h) = \phi(h')\). Then \(ah = ah'\), so \(h = h'\). Thus \(\phi\) is
    injective. Therefore, \(\order{aH} = \order{H}\). The proof for
    \(\order{Ha}\) is similar.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\). Then \(G\) is the disjoint union
    of the left (resp. right) cosets of \(H\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since left (resp. right) congruence modulo \(H\) is an equivalence relation
    on \(G\), the left (resp. right) cosets of \(H\) form a partition of \(G\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(H < G\) and let \(a, b \in G\). If \(aH = bH\), then \(a^{-1}b \in
    H\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since \(aH = bH\), we have \(a \in bH\), i.e., \(a = bh\) for some \(h \in
    H\). This implies that \(a^{-1}b = h \in H\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:normal-subgroup}
    A subgroup \(N\) of a group \(G\) is said to be \emph{normal} if for all \(g
    \in G\) and \(n \in N\),
    \[
        gng^{-1} \in N.
    \]
    If \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\), we write \(N \triangleleft G\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The operation \(gng^{-1}\) is called \emph{conjugation} by \(g\). Thus,
    Definition~\ref{def:normal-subgroup} can be stated as: a subgroup \(N\) of a
    group \(G\) is normal if it is invariant under conjugation by elements of
    \(G\).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    It immediately follows from the definition that every subgroup of an abelian
    group is normal. In general, however, not all subgroups are normal. An
    example of a commutative group where every subgroup is normal is the
    quaternion group \(Q_8\).
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
    A subgroup \(N\) of a group \(G\) is normal if and only if the left (resp.
    right) cosets of \(N\) are the same as the right (resp. left) cosets of
    \(N\). That is, left and right congruence modulo \(N\) define the same
    equivalence relation on \(G\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose \(N \triangleleft G\), and let \(a \in G\). Let \(x \in gN\). Then
    \(x = gn\) for some \(n \in N\). Since \(N \triangleleft G\), we have
    \(gng^{-1} \in N\), so \(x = gn = gng^{-1}g = n'g\) for some \(n' \in N\).
    Thus \(x \in Ng\) and \(gN \subset Ng\). The proof that \(Ng \subset gN\) is
    similar. Conversely, suppose that left and right cosets of \(N\) coincide.
    Let \(g \in G\) and \(n \in N\). Then \(gn \in Ng = gN\), so \(gn = n'g\)
    for some \(n' \in N\). This implies that \(gng^{-1} = n' \in N\), and since
    \(g\) and \(n\) were arbitrary, we have \(N \triangleleft G\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:normal-subgroup-props}
    Let \(N\) and \(K\) be subgroups of a group \(G\), with \(N\) normal in
    \(G\). Then:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(N \cap K\) is a normal subgroup of \(K\);
        \item \(NK\) is a subgroup of G and \(N\) is normal in \(NK = \{nk : n
        \in N, k \in K\}\); and
        \item if \(K\) is normal in \(G\) and \(N \cap K = \{e\}\), then \(kn =
        nk\) for all \(n \in N\) and \(k \in K\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove each part in turn.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), wide]
        \item The intersection \(H \cap K\) is a subgroup of \(K\) by
        Theorem~\ref{thm:intersection-subgroups}. Since \(N \triangleleft G\),
        we must have \(gng^{-1} \in N\) for all \(g \in G\) and \(n \in N\). Let
        \(x \in N \cap K\) and \(k \in K\). Then \(x \in K\) and because \(K <
        G\) (i.e., closed), we must have \(kxk^{-1} \in K\). On the other hand,
        we also have \(x \in N\) and because \(k \in K \subset G\) we have
        \(kxk^{-1} \in N\). Thus \(kxk^{-1} \in N \cap K\), and so \(N \cap K
        \triangleleft K\).
        
        \item Let \(a, b \in NK\). Then \(a = n_1k_1\) and \(b = n_2k_2\) for
        some \(n_1, n_2 \in N\) and \(k_1, k_2 \in K\). Since \(N \triangleleft
        G\), and \(k^{-1}_1k_1 = e \in N\), we have
        \[
            ab = (n_1k_1)(n_2k_2) = n_1k_1n_2(k^{-1}_1k_1)k_2 = n_1(k_1n_2k^{-1}_1)k_1k_2
        \]
        Since \(N\) is normal \(k_1n_2k^{-1}_1\) must be equal to some element
        \(n_3 \in N\), so \(ab = n_1n_3k_1k_2 \in NK\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:quotient-group}
    Let \(N \triangleleft G\). The set of all (left) cosets of \(N\) in \(G\)
    forms a group under the operation
    \[
        (aN)(bN) = abN,
    \]
    for all \(a, b \in G\). This is called the \emph{quotient group} of \(G\)
    modulo \(N\), denoted by \(G/N\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    First we show that the operation is well-defined. Suppose \(a, a', b, b' \in
    G\) such that \(aN = a'N\) and \(bN = b'N\). Then \(a^{-1}a' \in N\) and
    \(b^{-1}b' \in N\). The first statement implies that \(b^{-1}a^{-1}a' \in
    b^{-1}H = Hb^{-1}\) (because \(N\)) is normal. Thus there exists an element
    \(n \in N\) such that \(b^{-1}a^{-1}a' = nb^{-1}\); multiplying on the right
    by \(b'\) gives us \(b^{-1}a^{-1}a'b' = nb^{-1}b' \in N\). We can simplify
    this to \((ab)^{-1}(a'b') \in N\), which implies that \((ab)N = (a'b')N\).

    The operation is associative because multiplication in \(G\) is associative.
    The identity element of the group is \(eN = N\) where \(e\) is the identity
    element of \(G\). The inverse of \(aN\) is \(a^{-1}N\). Thus the set of all
    left cosets of \(N\) in \(G\) forms a group under the operation \((aN)(bN) =
    abN\).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The definition of a quotient group in Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient-group} uses
    left cosets for concreteness, but since we are dealing with a normal
    subgroup, it holds for right cosets as well.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(\phi : G \to H\) be a group homomorphism. Then the \(\ker \phi\) is a
    normal subgroup of \(G\). Conversely, if \(N\) is a normal subgroup of
    \(G\), then the map
    \[
        \pi : G \to G/N
    \]
    defined by \(\pi(g) = gN\) is an epimorphism with kernel \(N\). We call
    \(\pi\) the \emph{canonical projection}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We have already established that \(\ker \phi < G\). Let \(g \in G\) and \(n
    \in \ker \phi\). Write \(e'\) for the identity element of \(H\). Then
    \[
        \phi(gng^{-1}) = \phi(g)\phi(n)\phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)e'\phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)\phi(g^{-1}) = e'.
    \]
    Therefore, \(gng^{-1} \in \ker \phi\).

    On the other hand, since each element of \(G/N\) is of the form \(gN\) for
    some \(g \in G\), the map \(\pi\) is surjective. By our definition of coset
    multiplication, we also have
    \[
        \pi(g)\pi(g') = gN \cdot g'N = gg'N = \pi(gg'),
    \]
    so that \(\pi\) is a group homomorphism. Finally, the kernel of \(\pi\) is
    \[
        \ker \pi = \{g \in G : gN = N\} = N.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:induced-homomorphism}
    Let \(N\) be a normal subgroup of a group \(G\). If \(\phi: G \to H\) is a
    group homomorphism such that \(N \subset \ker \phi\), then there exists a
    unique group homomorphism \(\overline{\phi}: G/N \to H\) so that the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G \arrow{r}{\phi} \arrow[swap]{d}{\pi} & H \\
            G/N \arrow[dashed]{ur}{\overline{\phi}}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes. Here \(\pi: G \to G/N\) is the canonical projection map, defined
    by \(\pi(g) = gN\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(b \in aN\) for some \(a \in G\). Then \(b = an\) for some \(n \in N\).
    Thus \(\phi(b) = \phi(an) = \phi(a)\phi(n)\). Since \(N \subset \ker \phi\),
    we have \(\phi(n) = e\), so \(\phi(b) = \phi(a)\). This implies that
    \(\phi\) sends elements of \(G/N\) to elements of \(H\) in a well-defined
    manner and the map \(\overline{\phi}\) defined by \(\overline{\phi}(aN) =
    \phi(a)\) is similarly well-defined. Since
    \[
    \overline{\phi}(aNbN) = \overline{\phi}(abN) = \phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b) = \overline{\phi}(aN)\overline{\phi}(bN),
    \]
    the map \(\overline{\phi}\) is a group homomorphism. Because
    \(\overline{\phi}\) is determined by \(\phi\), the map \(\overline{\phi}\)
    is unique.

    We finally have
    \[
        (\overline{\phi} \circ \pi)(g) = \overline{\phi}(\pi(g)) = \overline{\phi}(gN) = \phi(g),
    \]
    and the diagram therefore commutes.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The map \(\overline{\phi}\) is called the \emph{homomorphism induced by
    \(\phi\)}.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    Given the same conditions as in the preceding theorem, the following
    statements hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(\img \phi = \img \overline{\phi}\).
        \item \(\ker \overline{\phi} = (\ker \phi)/N\).
        \item The map \(\overline{\phi}\) is an isomorphism if and only if
        \(\phi\) is an epimorphism and \(\ker \phi = N\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove each part in turn.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), wide]
        \item For any \(x \in \img \phi\), there exists an element \(g \in G\)
        such that \(x = \phi(g)\). Then \(\overline{\phi}(gN) = \phi(g) = x\),
        so \(x \in \img \overline{\phi}\). Conversely if \(x \in \img
        \overline{\phi}\), then there exists some coset \(gN\) such that \(x =
        \overline{\phi}(gN) = \phi(g)\), so \(x \in \img \phi\). Thus \(\img
        \phi = \img \overline{\phi}\).
        
        \item If a coset \(gN \in \ker \overline{\phi}\), then
        \(\overline{\phi}(gN) = \phi(g) = e\), so \(g \in \ker \phi\). This
        implies that \(\ker \overline{\phi} = \{gN : g \in \ker \phi\} = (\ker
        \phi)/N\).
        
        \item If \(\overline{\phi}\) is an isomorphism, then it is also an
        epimorphism. Since \(\img \phi = \img \overline{\phi}\),it follows that
        \(\phi\) is also an epimorphism. Since \(\overline{\phi}\) is also
        injective, we have \(\ker \overline{\phi} = \{e_{G/N}\} = N\) (by our
        definition of the identity element of \(G/N\)). Thus \(\ker \phi = N\).
        
        Conversely, if \(\phi\) is an epimorphism and \(\ker \phi = N\), then
        \(\img \phi = H = \img \overline{\phi}\) and \(\overline{\phi}\) is an
        epimorphism. Since \(\ker \overline{\phi} = (\ker \phi)/N = \{e_{G/N}\}
        = N\), \(\overline{\phi}\) is also injective and therefore an
        isomorphism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    We consider one important class of examples. The cyclic group \(\Z/n\Z\)
    have been previously defined as the equivalence classes of integers under
    the relation
    \[
        a \equiv b \pmod{n} \quad \text{if and only if} \quad n \mid (a - b).
    \]
    The condition \(n \mid (a - b)\) is equivalent to \(a - b \in n\Z\) (in
    additive notation). Since \(\Z\) is abelian, \(n\Z\) is a normal subgroup of
    \(\Z\). The quotient group \(\Z/n\Z\) is then the set of all cosets of
    \(n\Z\) in \(\Z\), i.e., the set of all equivalence classes of integers
    modulo \(n\). Using additive notation, we can write the equivalence class of
    an integer \(a\) as
    \[
        [a]_n = \{a + kn : k \in \Z\} = a + n\Z.
    \]
    Addition in \(\Z/n\Z\) matches our definition of coset multiplication above.

    Now consider some map \(\epsilon_g: \Z \to G\) (for some group \(G\) with
    order \(n\)) that sends an integer \(\nu\) to the element \(g^\nu \in G\).
    This map is a group homomorphism by the properties of exponents. The kernel
    of \(\epsilon_g\) is then given by
    \[
        \ker \epsilon_g = \{ \nu \in \Z : g^\nu = e \},
    \]
    which are precisely the integers \(\nu\) that divide the order of \(g\),
    which is \(n\). This in turn is the subgroup \(n\Z\). By Theorem
    \ref{thm:induced-homomorphism}, \(\epsilon_g\) can be decomposed through the
    quotient group \(\Z/n\Z\):
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Z \arrow{r}{\epsilon_g} \arrow[swap]{d}{\pi} & G \\
            \Z/n\Z \arrow[dashed, "\overline{\epsilon}_g" below]{ur}
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    That is, the map \(\epsilon_g\) induces a unique homomorphism
    \(\overline{\epsilon}_g: \Z/n\Z \to G\) such that \(\epsilon_g =
    \overline{\epsilon}_g \circ \pi\) where again \(\pi: \Z \to \Z/n\Z\) is the
    canonical projection map that sends an integer to its equivalence class
    modulo \(n\). The map \(\overline{\epsilon}_g\) is an isomorphism since
    \(\ker \epsilon_g = n\Z\) and \(\epsilon_g\) is an epimorphism.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Canonical decomposition of a group homomorphism]
    Every group homomorphism \(\phi: G \to H\) can be decomposed as follows:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G \arrow[r, two heads] \arrow[rrr, bend left, "\phi"]   & G/\ker\phi \arrow[r,"\sim" above, "\overline{\phi}" below]   & \operatorname{im}\phi \arrow[r, hook]  & H
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We omit the proof as it is simply a restatement of everything we have
    established so far.
\end{proof}

The next result is immediately implied in the preceding theorem but we state it
nonetheless because of its importance.

\begin{theorem}[First isomorphism theorem]
    Let \(\phi: G \to H\) be a group homomorphism. Then
    \[
        G/\ker \phi \cong \img \phi.
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Second isomorphism theorem]
    Let \(K\) and \(N\) be subgroups of a group \(G\) such that
    \(\normal{N}{G}\). Then \(N \cap K\) is normal in \(K\), and
    \[
        K/(N \cap K) \cong NK/N.
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Recall from Theorem~\ref{thm:normal-subgroup-props} that \(NK\) is a
    subgroup of \(G\) and \(N\) is normal in \(NK\). Consider the map
    \[
        \phi : K \to NK/N.
    \]
    Every element of \(NK/N\) is of the form \(nkN\) for some \(n \in N\) and
    \(k \in K\). Since \(N \triangleleft G\), this implies that \(nk = kn'\) for
    some \(n' \in N\) and \(nkN = kn'N = kN\). That is, every element of
    \(NK/N\) is the image of some element of \(K\) and \(\phi\) is surjective.
    Moreover, \(\phi\) is the composition
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            K \arrow[r, "\iota", hook] & NK \arrow[r, "\pi", two heads] & NK/N.
            \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    By the first isomorphism theorem, we then have
    \[
        K/\ker \phi \cong NK/N.
    \]
    But then
    \begin{align*}
        \ker \phi &= \{k \in K : \phi(k) = N\} = \{k \in K : kN = N\} = \{k \in K : k \in N\}\\ &= N \cap K,
    \end{align*}
    and the result follows.
\end{proof}

\section{Group actions}

\begin{definition}
    The action of a group \(G\) on an object \(X\) in a category \(\catg{C}\) is
    a (group) homomorphism
    \[
        \alpha: G \to \Aut_{\catg{C}}(X),
    \]
\end{definition}
